# merge-sort


Compared to bubble sort, merge sort is much better in most ways. Merge sort is faster and uses much less system memory. It also can handle big datasets, 
which is where bubble sort struggles. Bubblesort is way easier to code and understand however, so it thrives as a simple solution to sorting very small datasets or
for teaching people. Merge sort is fairly difficult to code and debug which makes it much less accessible.
